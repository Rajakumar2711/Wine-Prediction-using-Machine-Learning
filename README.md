# Wine-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset containing various features related to wine properties and their corresponding quality ratings.

## Programming Language

The project is implemented in Python.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. (list specific libraries and versions if applicable)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in `data/wine_quality.csv`. It contains information on various attributes of wines, such as alcohol content, acidity levels, etc., along with corresponding quality ratings.

## Model

We have implemented multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. The model with the highest performance was chosen for the final predictions.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score to assess its predictive accuracy.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone /wine-quality-prediction.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the main script:

bash
python main.py


## Results

The final model achieved an R2 score of 0.85, indicating a strong predictive capability for wine quality
